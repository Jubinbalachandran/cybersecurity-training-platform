pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Run the Application
python cybersecurity_platform.py
Step 3: Access the Platform
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000

Project Structure
After running the application, your project structure will look like:

Cybersecurity Awareness/
├── cybersecurity_platform.py
├── requirements.txt
├── cybersecurity_training.db
└── templates/
    ├── base.html
    ├── dashboard.html
    ├── modules.html
    ├── users.html
    └── reports.html





Key Features

Dashboard: Overview of key metrics
Training Modules: Manage cybersecurity training content
User Management: Track user progress and risk levels
Reports: Security metrics and analytics
Local Database: SQLite for data storage
Responsive UI: Works on desktop and mobile


Customization
Add new training modules by inserting records into the modules table
Modify HTML templates for branding
Extend API endpoints for additional features
Add authentication for production deployment
This implementation should work without any errors. The key changes I made:

Embedded HTML templates as strings in the Python file
Added a function to create template files on first run
Used render_template_string instead of render_template
Simplified the setup process
Run the application with python cybersecurity_platform.py and access it at http://localhost:5000.
