Recommended Step-by-Step Process
First, try pulling the remote changes:
git pull origin main
If you get a merge conflict, resolve it:

Edit any files that show conflicts
Remove conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
Save the files
Add and commit the merged changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Merge remote changes"
Push to GitHub:
git push -u origin main
Alternative: Start Fresh on GitHub
If you prefer to keep your local files and overwrite the remote repository:

Delete the repository on GitHub:

Go to your repository settings
Scroll to the bottom and click "Delete this repository"
Create a new empty repository:

Go to https://github.com/new
Name it cybersecurity-training-platform
Make sure "Initialize this repository with a README" is UNCHECKED
Click "Create repository"
Push your local files:

git push -u origin main
Verify Your Setup
After successfully pushing, verify everything worked:

# Check remote status
git remote -v

# Check commit history
git log --oneline
The first option (pull then push) is generally the safest approach as it preserves both your local work and any remote content. If you're just starting out and don't have important remote files, the force push option will work fine too.
